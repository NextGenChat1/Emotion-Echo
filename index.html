      "Dear You,\n\nI know you're tired. I know the nights feel longer than they used to. But please hold on a little longer. What you cannot see now is becoming the foundation of your strongest self.\n\nThe version of you I'm writing from has found peace â€” and they are so proud of how far youâ€™ve come.\n\nAlways,\nA future you",
      "Hey,\n\nYou may feel unseen, but youâ€™ve never been alone. Every tear youâ€™ve cried planted something soft in the universe. That softness lives in your eyes now. Donâ€™t hide it.\n\nLove,\nA soul who remembers you",
      "To You,\n\nYou forgot how brave you are. You survived storms no one even saw. That quiet strength? Itâ€™s your superpower.\n\nStop chasing who youâ€™re *supposed* to be. You're becoming someone better.\n\nâ€” A Voice Inside You",
      "Hello,\n\nYou may not recognize me. I'm the you that never gave up â€” not when they left, not when you broke, not even when hope felt embarrassing.\n\nIâ€™m still here. Waiting.\n\nLetâ€™s meet soon.\n\nâ€” Your Unbroken Self",
      "Dear Soul,\n\nWhat if youâ€™re not lost? What if youâ€™re just between chapters?\n\nKeep turning the page. The part where everything makes sense is closer than you think.\n\nWarmly,\nSomeone who sees your heart",
      "To the Fighter,\n\nYouâ€™ve carried so much. Pain, guilt, memories that refuse to fade.\n\nYou donâ€™t have to hold it all forever. Let a little go today.\n\nBreathe.\n\nYou made it this far â€” that matters more than you know.",
